# Environments

This is an example [Git pitch](https://github.com/gitpitch/in-60-seconds) using Reveal.js slides

## Base repo

The source is PITCHME.md

See the slides live at https://gitpitch.com/kiwidamien/environment_presentation

## Alternate presentation

We can also have multiple presentations per repo! We have to use the `?p=<path>` syntax to access them. The documentation on this is a little tricky to find.

To access the second presentation, use https://gitpitch.com/kiwidamien/environment_presentation?p=presentation2
